# Metasploit_Pro_Cracked_v4.21.1
Metasploit - A project dedicated to information security. Created to provide information about vulnerabilities, help in creating signatures for IDS, creating and testing exploits. The most famous project is Metasploit Framework - a convenient platform for creating and debugging exploits. In addition, the project includes a database of opcodes, an archive of shellcodes and information on information security researc. Download Last:

    Linux --> https://downloads.metasploit.com/data/releases/metasploit-latest-linux-x64-installer.run
    Windows --> https://downloads.metasploit.com/data/releases/metasploit-latest-windows-installer.exe

To crack, we will need to download an archive with ki script that we will replace at the root of the framework itself.
After we have downloaded this file, we need to move it along the path. write command /opt/metasploit-framework/bin/msfupdate and you can transfer it to a folder ( be sure to restart your PC! )

    application.html.erb --> /opt/metasploit/apps/pro/ui/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
    application_controller.rb --> /opt/metasploit/apps/pro/ui/app/controllers/application_controller.rb
    license.rb --> /opt/metasploit/apps/pro/ui/app/models/license.rb
    tasks.rb --> /opt/metasploit/apps/pro/engine/app/concerns/metasploit/pro/engine/rpc/tasks.rb

Next, to run Metasploit itself, you will need to go to the root directory and run msfpro, you can copy it to /usr/bin for a quick start (but it should happen automatically) Write in terminal to start cracked version:

    sudo systemctl restart metasploit && cd /opt/metasploit && msfdb init && s sudo msfpro
